                 <p class="caption">
                   <b>System Research</b><br>
                   In order to see the bigger picture of the food system, we had to think throught the circle of it, such as the source, the consumption, the waste and the supermarket. So, firstly, we visited city farms, community gardens, local gorcery, supermarket and local markets to observe how people manage and interact. But the insights were needed to be explored.

                <h3>Gain:</h3>
                 <p class="caption">
                   <b>Survey&Interviews</b><br>
                   First, from the initial survey, it gave me a new idea to compare with the experience of green grocer shoppers and supermarket preferers. After gathering the thoughts, I tried to zoom in to the important moment to find the obstacles and desires which are important when it comes to innovate the existing system. <br><br> 
                   <b>Zoom in to the important moment</b><br>

                   Talking with several people in those places or the people who choose extreme different options helps us to gain the insight about why they do this and how visiters do, think and feel. This step is crucial for us to find what is possible to make a sustainable future. Since we can see the behavioural changes in the urban city, which is that people long for the natural. Not only from the people who grow food locally, but from the people who consume the local shop to pursue the interaction between people and also nature.
                   <br>
                   In this step, it was obvious to see the things not good for the sustainable future, such as impulsively purchase, pursuing perfection affecting the 'imperfection' food wasted, lacking of knowledges of fruit limiting the better decision making etc. Also, some interesting desires caused the behaviours had been found.

                 <p class="caption">
                   <b>Behaviours</b><br>
                  From the existing behaviours, we found the potential benefits for the sustainable future, such as people growing the fruit tree at home, people sharing fruits with others and so on.
                 </p> 

                 <img src="images/foodsource.jpg" alt="">
                 <p class="caption">
                   <b>Future thinking: Up Cycling</b><br>
                  Also, from the current issue of food waste, we saw the potential solutions which is implementing the up cycling concept to deal with the wasted fruit problem. 
                 </p> 

                 <img src="images/foodfuture.jpg" alt="">
                
                 <p class="caption">
                   <b></b><br>
                  So how can we redesign an existing system based on those finding for the more sustainable future? The main steps in the system was kept, but in the everystep we made a little change aimed to encourage the consumers to consume responsibly in an intuitive way.

                 <h3>Outcome: Circular System</h3>
                 <p class="caption">The system is from the experiment the alternative journey of an apple sold in grocery shops. When an apple is bought and eaten, the rest of the apple which could be seeds, peels or other parts normally is thrown away. However, those parts can be made into plates, containers and so on, which could be a future material.</p> 
                 <img src="images/4746.jpg" alt="">
                 <p class="caption">Overall, there are four categories in the system: grocery, source, waste, materials.</p>
                 

                 <p class="caption">To optimise the sustainability of grocery shopping, the system is aimed to create a place where encourages people to learn about the food and buy with new criteria that is the natural 'best before' and grown by the local. Each fruit or vegetable is beyond itself, which is about nutrition, texture, season, land, climate etc. By seeing, touching and eating the food grown locally, it helps people to learn the place food are grown and they are living in. The relationship between food and people can be closer if we see the process and the way people deal with the food or the perspective of the place we live in could be reframed.</p>
                 <img src="images/system.png" alt="">
                 <p class="caption">In London, there are more and more community gardens and city farms in this area, as well as many people growing edible plants in their house or yards. Under the over-consumption and disposal city culture, single-use is a normality, which causes the future unsustainable. Thus, it is important to intervent or change the journey that one object is got and disposed or wasted.</p>
