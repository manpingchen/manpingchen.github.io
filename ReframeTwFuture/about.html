				<p>A way to communicate the topics that are related to the individual and the social between people, and citizen and government.</p>

			<p>The project is about redirecting the perspective of the future in Taiwan. It is aimed to bring the positive influence of  social participation and citizen power to the current society that most of the people have low confidence in the future. </p>

			<p>While talking on the wall is not a new idea that has been used in different periods and countries, the connotation of the wall is suitable for the project. Why? The first inspiration was , in London, while viewing the art work that communicates the social issues and walking on the street surrounded by the graffitis that shows the combinations of different perspectives, I started to think about what design can be and how it can be implemented. Considering how people live in a society, wall can be seen as a reminder, a memorial or a division. Since wall is everywhere, I regarded it as a good interaction platform for ordinary people to share ideas and make the tacit knowledge explicit. Moreover, I consider this kind of interaction is a bottom-up approach that provides the opportunities for people in wide ages to share, communicate, interact and paritcipate. </p>



			<p>From another aspect, in our environment, there are so many places encouraging people to consume, and so many discourses complaining about the old generation or governments. The discourses online is a good place for people to engage and share different points of view, but the massive information easily get either confused or forgotten. Thus, the talking wall has its own meaning and function which are more inclusive and temporal.  

			<h4>Sharing in the public space</h4>
			<p>Due to the meaning and function of talking wall, we think it is a good way to open up the questions that are firmly defined by the meta-narratives, such as how we should live our lives, what the intention we should have for the work and so on. The topics are often cultural or religion, which is hard to change massively in the short term but can be started to be questioned. In this project, we have been studying how people perceive the future life in Taiwan. Hence, we first brought the different perspectives or imaginations of the wanted future lives from London and shared them on the wall. Also, we invited people to co-building the wall, sharing their perspectives or imaginations. We believe that sharing is a relaxing start to find different perspectives, which is an approach to change the defined perspective.</p>

			<p>The topic discussed in a co-reframing project is work-Life nalance, while the perspective of work is firmly framed and the perspective of life is not discussed that much. We created the wall based on this idea to bring more discussions about the life we want in the future.</p>

			<p>Thinking about the complexity of the issue we are talking, the topic is interwoven between the individuals and the society. Thus, the physical wall provides the opportunity to have their voices been heard and encourage people to rethink and reframe. </p>

			<h4>Redirect the future by sharing and combining</h4>
			<p>From the SECI knowledge swirl model, it shows that how the knowledge is processed from tacit to explicit or from one person to a group of people. To challenge the defined perspectives, it is the time to see how we process the cognitive knowledge and how we change our knowledge. By gathering the individual tacit knowledge by written or drawn in the society, it can be a catalyst for people to combine their own perspectives and generate new perspectives. During the new perspective is generated and shared, it is the process of changing the future.</p>

			<p>Based on this concept, we invite people to create the wall together. </p>
